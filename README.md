# Technologies
1. React Native
2. Node
3. Express
4. Firebase
5. Kraken API

# Approach

The project was initially started by designing and creating wireframes. This not only helped drive the styling but helped define the components that would need to be made in react. Then I moved into a proof of concept by generating some api calls from some cryptocurrency exchanges. Once this was accomplished I began testing some helloworld React Native apps.

Then development of some mockups in React Native began. Once these were completed I integrated the api data to the frontend and had a working prototype.

From there I started working on the profile screen and authentication functionality.
