# Auth0 + React Native + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, React Native and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

## Configuring the example

You must set your Auth0 `ClientId` and `Domain` in this sample so that it works. For that, just open the `auth0-credentials.js` file and replace the `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{DOMAIN}` fields with your account information.

## Running the example

### iOS
1. `react-native run-ios`

### Android
1. `react-native run-android`

Enjoy your React Native app now :).
